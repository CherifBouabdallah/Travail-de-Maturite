# Welcome to my Travail de MaturitÃ©!

This code is part of my TM and will be in my final high school grade.

> :warning: **The quality of this code is not guaranteed as it's my first full-scale Python project.**

## Refraction Simulator

This repository contains a Python program that simulates the refraction of light. The simulator uses the Pygame library to create a graphical user interface for interactively adjusting the refractive indices and angles to observe the refraction phenomenon.

### Requirements

To run this simulator, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system.

### Features

- The program displays a graphical interface with sliders to control the refractive indices and angles.
- The sliders allow you to set the refractive index of two mediums (RI1 and RI2) and the incident angle of the light beam.
- The program calculates the angle of refraction based on the input parameters.
- It simulates the path of the laser as it travels through the interface between the objects and refracts accordingly.
- The output is displayed in real-time, and you can observe the changes in the path of the laser as you adjust the sliders.

### Note
